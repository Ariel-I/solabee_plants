# SolabeePlants

Solabee Plants is a gem that scrapes the Solabee Flowers website returning the plants that are available for purchase. Upon entering the interface the user can choose a plant. After choosing the number of the plant they are interested the user will be shown the price and bio of the chosen plant. From there, they are able to either return to the list of plants or exit the interface.
