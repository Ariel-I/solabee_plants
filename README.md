<h2>Description</h2>

 Solabee Plants is a command-line interface that scrapes the Solabee Flowers website returning the plants that are available for purchase. Upon entering the interface the user can choose a plant. After choosing the number of the plant they are interested the user will be shown the price and bio of the chosen plant. From there, they are able to either return to the list of plants or exit the interface. 


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

-- You can find the Solabee Plants CLI in the github repository @ https://github.com/Ariel-I/solabee_plants --

In order to properly run the program you must clone the github repository from the link provided above. After cloning the repo be sure your terminal is inthe right file by typing 'cd solabee_plants' and hitting enter. Then you must install the gems:


gem intsall pry  

gem install nokogiri


After these gems are installed you can run the program by inputting ./bin/solabee-plants

<h2>How To</h2>

Interacting with the interface is the fun part! simply run the program, once you are presented with the welcome message and the list of plants;

1. Choose the number of a plant you would like more information about. 

2. Input that number and press enter! 

You will be presented with your chosen plants price and a short bio informing you of the care needed for that specific plant. From there the user can press any key to return to the main list or type exit to end the program.
